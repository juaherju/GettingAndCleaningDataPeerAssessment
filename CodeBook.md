## Getting and Cleaning Data - peer assessment project


## The original data was transformed by
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set (adding an activitylabel column)
4. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

###First output 
* meanandstddevdata.txt: contains only the measurements of a mean or standard deviation, subject and activity information.

###Second output 
* tidydata.txt: is calculated with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
